# nathansh WordPress theme
This is the WordPress theme for [nathansh.com](http://nathansh.com). I figured I'd put it up here as an ultimate 'view source' for my website. Feel free to poke around, see how things are done, tweet me any questions @_nathansh, and if you're feeling adventurous make a pull request.

Note that custom post types, taxonomies and some other functionality is defined in the companion [site plugin repo](https://github.com/nathanshubert/nathansh.com-plugin).

## Boilerplates
This theme was built upon several boilerplates, which I'm the principle maintainer of (except for the Grunt one). These are collectively used and contributed to at [Domain7](http://www.domain7.com) where I work as a web developer.

* [WordPress theme boilerplate](github.com/domain7/wp-theme_boilerplate)<br />
This is the latest encarnation of my WordPress theme boilerplate, previously known as PressPenguin. I brought this to Domain7 and has evolved considerably since.
* [Sassyplate](https://github.com/domain7/sassyplate)<br />
A boilerplate for Sass/Compass.
* [Gruntyplate](https://github.com/domain7/gruntyplate)<br />
Used for getting grunt off on the right foot. Great defaults for combined media queries, script concatonation, compass compiling, etc. Primarily maintained by [Reuben Moes](https://github.com/reubenmoes/)

### Site functionality plugin boilerplate
[WordPress site plugin boilerplate](https://github.com/domain7/wp-plugin_boilerplate)<br />
Custom post types, taxonomies and a lot of site functionality should live in plugins, not themes. This boilerplate is for creating such plugins.
